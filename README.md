 Speech recognition model with minimal errors using Python packages such as pyaudio and speech-recognition and the model can beusedin various applications.

It enables both speech recognition and text-to-speech functionality. It utilizes the speech_recognition library to capture audio input from the user through a microphone. The Recognizer class from this library is initialized to manage speech recognition tasks. Inside an infinite loop, the program continuously listens for the user's voice input.

When the user speaks, the program adjusts for ambient noise using adjust_for_ambient_noise() to enhance the accuracy of speech recognition. It then records the audio input (audio2) and employs Google's speech recognition service (recognize_google) to convert the recorded speech into text (MyText). The recognized text is converted to lowercase for consistency.

The program prints the recognized text (MyText) to the console, confirming what the user said. It handles exceptions such as RequestError and UnknownValueError, ensuring robustness in case of network issues or when the speech recognition cannot understand the input.

To complement its speech recognition capability, the program also integrates text-to-speech functionality using the pyttsx3 library. The SpeakText() function initializes the text-to-speech engine (pyttsx3.init()), converts the text (MyText) into speech, and speaks it aloud using the say() and runAndWait() methods.
